# RBF_Function_Approximation

The radial basis function (RBF) network has its foundation in the conventional approximation theory. It has the capability of universal approximation. The RBF network is a popular alternative to the well-known multilayer perceptron (MLP), since it has a simpler structure and a much faster training process.

Here, I train a RBF Neural Network for function approximation.

Use this network and predict the F(x) = x^3, then compare the output of the network with the results of the function F(x) and plot the comparison for the data in range of x âˆˆ [-2, 2].
